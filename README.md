# Django_WebApp

The app is built using the Django framework, which is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
The database used in the app is PostgreSQL which is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. 
The web app also makes use of various Python packages such as Django Rest Framework for creating APIs and Bootstrap for styling the front-end.
